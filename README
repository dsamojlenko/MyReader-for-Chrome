If you spend as much time in Google Reader as I do, and you hate the new Reader look as much as I do, and you happen to use Chrome – then perhaps you’d be interested in the MyReader Chrome Extension.

This extension borrows heavily from @dazchong’s Reeder For Chrome project. I stand on his shoulders in putting this together – without Reeder For Chrome, I would not have attempted this on my own. If you like Reeder on iOS, then perhaps you’d prefer his extension over mine.
